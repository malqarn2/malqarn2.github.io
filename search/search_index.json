The FD3057, while less well-documented, has been verified in the lab to produce clearly audible tones in this range.</p> </li> <li> <p>Size and mechanical integration </p> </li> <li>FD3057 is physically larger but easy to mount on a simple panel or bracket and already matches the kit hardware.  </li> <li>CDS-16098A is ultra-compact (16 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 3 mm) and ideal for a tight enclosure, at the cost of more complex mounting. </li> <li> <p>AS02808MR-R offers an intermediate option: smaller than FD3057 but still round, making it straightforward to integrate in a future enclosure design. </p> </li> <li> <p>Cost and availability </p> </li> <li>FD3057 is effectively free for the project because it is included in the lab kit.  </li> <li> <p>CDS-16098A and AS02808MR-R are both low-cost (~$2\u20133), widely available parts from standard distributors, so they are realistic options for later iterations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Final justification    Given the current course constraints, the FD3057 kit speaker is selected as the primary component for the AutoCan design. It satisfies the electrical requirements (8 \u03a9, \u22480.5\u20131 W), is loud enough for alerts in a lab/vehicle environment, and requires no additional cost or PCB changes.    At the same time, documenting three fully-specified alternatives demonstrates that the design could easily migrate to a compact micro-speaker (CDS-16098A) or a more standard 28 mm round speaker (AS02808MR-R) without redesigning the power or driver circuitry.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<ul> <li>All major components for the speaker subsystem (speaker, driver transistors, coupling capacitor, and 5 V supply) are explicitly listed.  </li> <li>The speaker component itself has three detailed options, each with specs, pros/cons, and use cases.  </li> <li>The decision-making process connects the final choice directly to the subsystem requirements: impedance, power, frequency range, mechanical size, cost, and compatibility with the existing 5 V amplifier.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"BOM","text":"<p>title: Bill of Materials</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This circuit provides power and signal connections for a Curiosity Nano microcontroller board.
