This motor is used to automatically open and close the lid based on sensor input, such as motion or proximity detection. When the sensor detects an object or a user\u2019s hand near the lid, the control circuit sends a signal to the DC motor to rotate in one direction, lifting the lid. After a short delay, the motor reverses its direction to close the lid smoothly. The system is designed to improve hygiene and enhance convenience by allowing users to dispose of waste without physical contact.</li> <li>Add context that ties into the link to your team report.</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<ul> <li>My specific contribution focused on the DC Motor Control System, which manages the automatic lid mechanism.
