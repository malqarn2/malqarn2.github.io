## Overview
This circuit provides power and signal connections for a Curiosity Nano microcontroller board.
It includes a 5 V linear regulator (LM7805) to supply stable voltage to the microcontroller and components.
A two-transistor amplifier (2N3904 & 2N3906), biased by 1N4148 signal diodes, boosts the audio output before driving the FD3057 speaker included in the lab kit.
The design also incorporates a 10 µF coupling capacitor to filter DC offset and protect the speaker.
