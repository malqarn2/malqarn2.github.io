## Overview
This circuit provides power and signal connections for a Curiosity Nano microcontroller board.
It includes a 5 V regulator (LM7805) to power the board and components, and an op-amp (LM324) to buffer a sensor input before it reaches the Nano’s analog input.

The schematic also includes resistors and capacitors for signal conditioning and voltage regulation, and a 2×4 connector (J2) for external I/O connections.
A photoresistor (LDR) is used as the analog sensor, and all parts share a common ground reference.

The Bill of Materials (BOM) lists standard, easily available components from Digi-Key, making the design practical and low-cost for prototyping or small-scale builds.
