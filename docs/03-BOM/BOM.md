title: Bill of Materials


## Overview
This circuit provides power and signal connections for a Curiosity Nano microcontroller board.
It includes a 5 V regulator (LM7805) to power the board and components, and an op-amp (LM324) to buffer a sensor input before it reaches the Nano’s analog input.

the motor driver FIT0492-A, which drives the DC motor to open or close the lid.

The Bill of Materials (BOM) lists standard, easily available components from Digi-Key, making the design practical and low-cost for prototyping or small-scale builds.
