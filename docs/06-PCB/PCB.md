## Overview

The barrel jack takes 9 V power and passes it through a 150 mA fuse.

The LM7805 voltage regulator changes 9 V to 5 V for the rest of the circuit.

A Curiosity Nano board plugs in to control everything.

A push button and LED are used for user input and indication.

The speaker circuit uses two transistors (2N3904 + 2N3906) and some resistors, diodes, and a capacitor to drive the speaker.

The blue area is the ground plane, and red tracks carry the signals and 5 V power.
