## Overview

This schematic provides power and signal connections for a Curiosity Nano microcontroller board.
It includes a 5 V regulator, an op-amp circuit for analog signal buffering, and an LED indicator.

Power: A 9 V input (J1) is regulated to 5 V using the LM7805. The 5 V output powers the Curiosity Nano and other components.

Controller: The Curiosity Nano handles input and output signals through connector J2.

Op-Amp (LM324): Used to buffer or amplify an analog signal before sending it to the Nanoâ€™s analog input.

LED Indicator: The LED (D1) with resistor (R1) provides a basic power or status indication.
