## Overview
This block diagram illustrates how the speaker output system operates using a Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano microcontroller board. The system converts digital audio signals generated by the Nano into audible sound through a speaker (FD3057) powered by a 5V voltage regulator (LM7805).

The DAC1 (RD5) pin on the Curiosity Nano outputs an analog signal that feeds into the amplifier circuit, which increases the signal strength before driving the speaker. The amplifier is powered by the regulated 5V supply to ensure stable operation and consistent audio output quality.

Additionally, UART1 (RC2, RC3) is used for communication, allowing debugging or serial control during testing. The RE2 digital I/O pin and external connector provide flexibility for connecting other peripherals or sensors.
