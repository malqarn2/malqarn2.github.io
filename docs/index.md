## Introduction

* This needs to be updated so that a reader gets an idea of the purpose of this datasheet.

### Project Summary

*The part I’m working on is the DC motor system, which is responsible for controlling the lid mechanism of the smart trash bin. This motor is used to automatically open and close the lid based on sensor input, such as motion or proximity detection. When the sensor detects an object or a user’s hand near the lid, the control circuit sends a signal to the DC motor to rotate in one direction, lifting the lid. After a short delay, the motor reverses its direction to close the lid smoothly. The system is designed to improve hygiene and enhance convenience by allowing users to dispose of waste without physical contact.
